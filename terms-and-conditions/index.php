         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;You agree that you have entered into this Agreement with Symbio Energy Limited in your personal capacity via the website, via a price comparison site, energy broker or authorised switching agents such as We Flip or Flipper.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;You agree to provide us with accurate information, in case you are a tenant applying for a switch, you agree to furnish Symbio Energy Limited, with the Landlord/owner name and contact details at the time of the switch.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">SUPPLY COMMENCEMENT </span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.1 Symbio Energy Limited is authorised to provide the supply of electricity to a customer from the provisions detailed in Clause 1.2 and the provisions in Clause 3 (required information).</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.2 Symbio Energy Limited will commence supply based on the Retail Energy Code (REC). It currently takes between 14 to 21 days, although this is due to improve with all parties in the electricity market seeking to reduce switch times. We may change the start date for the supply if we do not&nbsp; have all the information we need. We will write to you during the process to update you on progress. There are numerous counterparties in a switch of supply and the amount of time taken to switch is dependent upon the counterparties performing their duties diligently.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.3 The customer is responsible for any charges to be paid to their old supplier. Your old supplier&nbsp; can refuse a switch/change of supplier if there is an outstanding debt owed to them.&nbsp; If your old supplier refuses the request for a switch, the switch will be canceled. However, you are free to request another switch at any time. Please note suppliers cannot refuse a request to switch without a valid reason. Often, it is an outstanding final bill payment, or the customer is still in contract&nbsp; (usually a fixed term contract&nbsp; attracting a termination fee).</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.4 It is the customer’s responsibility to submit their Estimated Annual Consumption(EAC) for the last 12 months, we will compare the EAC provided with the Industry Standards, if the EAC is below the Industry Standards, Symbio Energy Limited will request customers to provide us with previous electricity bills to support their claim.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.5 It is mandatory to provide an opening meter reading with the meter picture within 10 days. In case a meter reading is not submitted within three months of the switch date to Symbio Energy Limited, the tariff will be automatically changed to the default tariff.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.5.1 The Customer will be sent at least three email reminders, seeking an opening meter reading, If the opening meter reading is not provided by the customer and is later disputed with the old supplier, the customer must provide a photo evidence to substantiate the claim, as at the time of the switch. </span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The opening meter reading can be disputed only if the variance between the submitted reading and the estimated reading is 250.0 kWh or more.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.5.2 In case an opening meter reading was not submitted at the time of the switch and this results in a dispute with the other supplier, please be advised Symbio Energy Limited reserves the right to charge a minimum administration fee of £10.00 for not submitting the opening meter reading, when requested and thereby leading to a dispute.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.5.3 A meter reading must be submitted by the end of every month, if a meter reading is submitted after the cut-off date, the meter reading will be considered in the next billing cycle.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.5.4 If the customer provides a meter reading which is 10% below the expected profile or EAC, you will be requested to submit photographic evidence. If evidence is not provided, customer will be asked to pay as per the estimates.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.6 Symbio Energy Limited, follows an Advance Billing System, hence customers are billed one month in advance based on the Estimated Annual Consumption and seasonal estimates. Upon receiving the meter reading at the end of the month, the bill will be reconciled in line with the meter reading received. Any over or under collection will be adjusted in the following bill. The process of reconciliation and estimating one month in advance is a continuous process.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">2.6.1 At the end of the Agreement, if there is a credit on the account it will be either refunded back to you or should you choose to stay with us, it will carried to the next billing month, however, if there is an outstanding amount on the account, we will collect the amount from you.</span></span></span></p>

         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.1 You are responsible for paying Symbio Energy Limited for your energy consumption until this Agreement ends or until you stop using the services provided by us, whichever is later.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.2 Symbio Energy Limited will only offer paperless billing to reduce the cost of credit control. Credit control is an additional avoidable cost which increases energy prices to customers. It is also more sustainable for the environment by not printing on paper. However, should you request a paper bill every month, a charge of £5.00 per bill will be applicable and added to your monthly bill. Symbio Energy Limited will waive certain terms for vulnerable customers or customers who require financial assistance. Vulnerable, elderly customers are encouraged to call our customer services department and we will be happy to assist.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>

With system enhancements, Symbio Energy Limited may ask for authentication and specific information which provides confidential authority to operate the account. This is a security measure to stop unauthorised parties from accessing your energy account.</span></span></span></p>

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.3.1 Half hourly commercial customers have additional charges applied due to the amount of energy that is consumed, such as capacity charges. These will be transparent and detailed on the estimated quote provided before the switch.</span></span></span></p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.3.2 Symbio Energy Limited will invoice the customer in advance based on the estimated annual energy consumption of the premises receiving the energy supply. The amount taken on the first direct debit will vary depending on when in the month, the switch to Symbio Energy Limited has occurred. We estimate your consumption as per the Estimated Annual Consumption and then upon receiving the meter reading, we reconcile it with the estimated units charged, the bill amount will be collected via direct debit. At the end of the Deemed Contract, the customer will be given a refund if Symbio Energy Limited is holding onto any credit balances or a final direct debit amount will be taken to settle any outstanding invoices.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.3.3 The electricity consumption in winter is significantly higher than in summer. Therefore,&nbsp; payments in winter are based on winter estimates and summer bills will be in line with the summer usage.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.3.4 In order to assist with the switch to Symbio Energy Limited tariffs, an opening meter read must be submitted by the customer. </span></span></span></p>

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.3.6 Symbio Energy Limited will endeavour to offer customers a suitable date for direct debits, if requested by the customer. In exceptional circumstances where&nbsp; there may be processes or system errors, Symbio Energy Limited will take reasonable steps to rectify any error but will not be liable for any damages directly or consequential loss.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.4 Symbio Energy Limited reserves the right to cancel any switch to its tariffs before the effective switch date if any of the details of the terms in Clause 3.2 are not met. Customers who are unable to fulfill the criteria detailed in Clause 3.2 will be notified that the switch to Symbio Energy Limited tariff has been aborted. Customers will be given the opportunity to rectify the missing or incorrect information before the switch is aborted. Customers who are subject to an abortive switch will be given the opportunity to re-register for a Symbio Energy Limited tariff once all the qualification information is received and validated.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.5 If you have a standard meter, you must either pay the amount shown on your bill via direct debit or the fixed monthly (seasonal) amount you have agreed to pay in advance. This is detailed in the tariff you have chosen.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.6 If you have a prepayment meter, you must top-up your meter in advance in order to receive the supply, and we will deduct charges for the supply from the credit amount you hold. </span></span></span></p>

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.8 If you ask us to test the accuracy of your meter, you must pay us an amount to cover the cost of the work being carried out. We will tell you what this amount is at the time, and we will provide a breakdown of the costs if you ask us for one. If the National Measurement Office decides that the meter is operating outside of the statutory limits, we will refund the payment to you.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.9 If you are on a Deemed Contract, then you must pay your bills via Direct Debit. Symbio Energy Limited only offers Direct Debit Agreement to reduce costs, the benefits are then passed onto the customer. Exceptions are made for vulnerable or elderly customers.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.10 If you have a prepayment meter installed or if you agree to have a prepayment meter installed, you will be placed on our prepayment meter energy plan and rates. However, we understand that prepayment meters are a matter of last resort and our prepayment rates will not penalize customers. They will be higher than our normal tariffs but only sufficiently higher to cover the additional costs of administration.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.11 If you are under a Deemed Contract and you have a prepayment meter, or if you change to a prepayment meter for any reason while under an Agreement with us, you will automatically be placed onto our prepayment energy plan.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.12 If you are having trouble paying your bill, you should contact us immediately to discuss ways to reduce your liability&nbsp; and the payment methods available to you.

         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.13 If for any reason your direct debit cannot be collected on the agreed date, we will send you an email reminder. If the direct debit is not reinstated, we will write to you to make a payment by BACS transfer or online payment and we will have to add £10 to your energy bill to cover the cost of credit control and or reinstate your direct debit. If the direct debit is cancelled by the customer during the Agreement, we also reserve our right to place the customer on the default non-direct debit tariff automatically, subject to 9.1. We will write to the customer to inform them of this and encourage them to resolve the situation or to find a cheaper alternative which allows paper billing and non-direct debit payment methods.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.13.1 A late payment fee of £10, will be applied if the payment has not been received within 30 days of issuing you a bill. In case the payments are repeatedly defaulted; a warning letter will be issued to the customer. We reserve the right to supply energy and we can ask customers to switch to another energy supplier or they will be automatically moved to our default tariff.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;If at any time you are having difficulty paying your bill, we advise you to contact us immediately and discuss ways and payment method available to you.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.14 We will carry any debit or credit balance forward to the next month’s bill.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.15 In order to bill you as accurately as possible, you must give us an up-to-date meter reading for your energy consumption by the last day of every month and/or when requested by Symbio Energy Limited if there is a reason for a more up to date meter reading. If you switch supplier from Symbio Energy Limited, you will be required to provide a final meter reading with a meter picture. A final bill will be generated when we receive a closing meter reading from your new supplier. </span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.16 You must keep your account in credit by paying for the supply in advance by automatic payment, or if you are in debt with us, you agree to not be in debt by more than half of what we have&nbsp; calculated as being your expected bill based on your Estimated Annual consumption (EAC).</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3.17 Your automatic monthly payment amount will be based on the cost of the energy we think you will use during a year with Symbio Energy Limited split as per seasonal estimates. The electricity consumption in winter is significantly higher than in summer, hence the payments in winter will be based on the winter consumption, which will be slightly higher.

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">11.1 Our liability (including for negligence and breach of statutory duty) is limited to £10,000 for each unconnected event that we are directly responsible for, or £10,000 in total for any connected series of events that we are directly responsible for, and which has caused you loss or damage. We are responsible for any liability which is not capable of being excluded by law.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">11.2 Except in relation to any liability which is not capable of being excluded by law, we are not liable for any loss or damage (including negligence and breach of statutory duty) that we could not reasonably have expected would result from breach of this Agreement at the time you entered into it.</span></span></span></p>

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">11.5 As we do not directly control the reliability of energy to your property, we cannot&nbsp; guarantee that the supply will be uninterrupted.

         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">14.1 We are acting on behalf of your network operator to make an agreement with you.

We will follow our complaints policy and revert to you within 28 working days (depending on the complexity of the complaint). Symbio Energy is also a member of the Ombudsman Scheme and should we fail to resolve your complaint within 8 weeks or on receipt of the deadlock letter, you may contact the Ombudsman Services to have your complaint independently reviewed.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">15.2 In certain cases, when you raise a complaint, we may request you to provide us, with further information to fully investigate and resolve the matter. However, should we not receive any communication from you and as a result, there is a delay in resolving the complaint, we reserve our right to issue a deadlock letter until we hear from you. You should then provide us the requested time frame to resolve the issue internally.</span></span></span></p>
         <p><span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;15.3 Prior to escalating the complaint to the independent regulators, it is mandatory to register your complaint with us and follow the complaint procedure outlined by Symbio Energy Limited on our website. This includes granting us the required timeframe to resolve your complaint as per our internal complaint procedure. However, if the complaint procedure is not adhered to, and the complaint is escalated to the Regulatory body, we reserve the right to continue to offer our services and may encourage you to find another energy provider.</span></span></span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>

We are committed to continue providing an excellent service to all our customers as well as competitive tariffs within the UK. However, customers who choose to use social media to denigrate a company are engaged in a form of cyber bullying and it is not something that we, at Symbio Energy support. If you approach social media without contacting us or giving us an opportunity to resolve your query, Symbio Energy may encourage you to find another provider if you are unhappy with our services.</span></span></span></p>
