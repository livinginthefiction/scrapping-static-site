                        "text": "The electricity market works on Estimated Annual Consumption (EAC) and Profile Classes. This is an average estimated energy usage based on a property type and the average number of people living in this property. It follows that if you live in a 3-bedroom semi-detached house with just your partner, your EAC will be higher than your actual usage and you will have an estimated monthly bill which is higher than your actual energy usage. Conversely, if you live in a 3-bedroom house with 4 children who are constantly gaming, then the EAC will be lower than the actual usage and you will have an estimated monthly bill which is lower than your actual energy usage. It is important to remember; you can only be charged for what you use. Therefore, if you have overpaid, this money is yours and due back to you. Conversely, if you have used more energy than the EAC, you will have to top up the difference. You only pay for what you have used. Meter readings reconcile the estimates with your actual reads. Some people like to provide monthly reads and have accurate energy bills monthly. Others provide less frequent reconciliations. We request you to submit the meter reading at the end of each month. This can be submitted via the Customer On-Line portal or by calling customer services. We are working on a Phone App and other novels, easier methods for our customers. Meter readings submitted after the last day of each month will be considered in the next billing cycle. If we do not receive a meter read in time, the bill will be based on the estimates submitted in the switch application."

                      "name": "THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF NEW ELECTRICITY COMPANIES THAT HAVE GONE BUST TRYING TO PROVIDE CHEAPER RATES. WILL SYMBIO BE JOINING THEM?",

                        "@type": "Answer",
                        "text": "This is a fair and reasonable question. After all, why can we afford to be cheaper without going bust when the others are so much more expensive? The electricity market is complex with many, many, counterparties in the market and each of these parties adds to the price of electricity. The biggest cost is staffing in a complex market and of course in the case of the larger companies, shareholders and expensive management boards. Symbio Energy can mitigate this as a new entrant by utilising the latest software solutions and architecture to minimise staff costs and of course, we do not have a bloated management structure. Our hope is to emulate the growth in low cost airlines by concentrating on technology, increasing efficiency and minimising waste costs. Most importantly, the failures in the industry have arisen due to cash flow management. This is difficult as the price of energy fluctuates dramatically and due to customers, that fail to pay. Failure occurs if sufficient buffers of cash have not been kept addressing unexpected spikes in energy prices and provisions for climate change. Symbio is currently sending bills, a month after an effective switch and monies are collected up to 4 weeks later. This is a huge strain as credit and bank costs are onerous. Hence like the rest of the industry we will be moving to taking a direct debit based on the estimated advance usage by a customer for the forthcoming month. The bill once invoiced will be set off against the monies held on account and a balancing payment requested equivalent to estimated consumption of energy expected. When a customer leaves, the final bill will be a small refund to the customer or a small final bill. In order to keep prices low, we only offer direct debit tariffs at present so that delayed payments do not affect the company and the many customers who are able to pay on time. We do however understand that circumstances change and we will always find ways of assisting those in trouble due to a change of circumstance."
